# Overview

We make one directional audio communication device using ESP32 and MAX98357.

Audio data is transmitted over ESP-NOW. So the data will even work without a WiFi network!

# Setup

The pins for the microphone and the amplifier board are all setup in the same `config.h` file.

# Building and Running

I'm using PlatformIO for this project so you will need to have that installed. Open up the project and connect your ESP32. You should be able to just hit build and run.

Obviously, you'll need two ESP32 boards and components to do anything :)
